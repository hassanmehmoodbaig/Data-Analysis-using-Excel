# 2023-2024 NBA Player Stats | Playoffs

In this project, we will conduct a comprehensive data analysis of NBA player statistics during the 2023-2024 playoffs. The analysis will be executed in five structured steps, each focusing on a critical aspect of the data analysis process.

## Steps of Analysis

### Step 1: Data Gathering
For this analysis, we gathered our dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). The dataset includes player statistics, team performance metrics, and other relevant information from the playoffs. You can also download the dataset directly from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com).

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
In this step, we will preprocess the data to ensure its quality. This involves:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types as needed
- Standardizing column names for consistency

### Step 3: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis will allow us to understand the data better. We will:
- Summarize key statistics
- Identify patterns and trends
- Explore relationships between different variables
- Use descriptive statistics to provide insights into player performance

### Step 4: Data Visualization Using Excel
In this step, we will create various visualizations in Excel to present our findings. This includes:
- Charts (bar, line, scatter) to depict player stats
- Pivot tables for comparative analysis
- Dashboards to provide an interactive overview of the data

### Step 5: Advanced Data Analysis
Finally, we will dive deeper into advanced analytical techniques, such as:
- Regression analysis to predict player performance
- Clustering to group similar players or teams
- Time series analysis to observe performance trends over the playoff period

By the end of this project, we aim to derive meaningful insights from the 2023-2024 NBA playoffs data, contributing to a better understanding of player performances and team dynamics.
