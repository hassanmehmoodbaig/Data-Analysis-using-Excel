# 2023-2024 NBA Player Stats | Playoffs

In this project, we will conduct a comprehensive data analysis of NBA player statistics during the 2023-2024 playoffs. The analysis will be executed in five structured steps, each focusing on a critical aspect of the data analysis process.

## Steps of Analysis

### Step 1: Data Gathering
For this analysis, we gathered our dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes player statistics, team performance metrics, and other relevant information from the playoffs. You can also download the dataset directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedsaqibshouqi/2023-2024-nba-player-stats-playoffs).
After downloading the file and importing it into Google Spreadsheet, it should be looking like this:

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
In this step, we will preprocess the data to ensure its quality. This involves:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types as needed
- Standardizing column names for consistency

In our case, the dataset is pretty cleaned so we can skip this step and go right into EDA.

### Step 3: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis will allow us to understand the data better. We will:
- Summarize key statistics
- Identify patterns and trends
- Explore relationships between different variables
- Use descriptive statistics to provide insights into player performance

Here are some questions we will be answering using this dataset.

*1. Which team has the most players in the dataset?*

*2. What are the average Point Per Game (PPG), Rebounds Per Game (RPG), and Assists Per Game (APG)?*

*3. Identify Players with PPG above 20 and APG above 5.*

*4. Which team has the highest and lowest average usage percentage (USG%)*

### Step 4: Data Visualization Using Excel
In this step, we will create various visualizations in Excel to present our findings. This includes:
- Charts (bar, line, scatter) to depict player stats
- Pivot tables for comparative analysis
- Dashboards to provide an interactive overview of the data

Here are some questions we will be answering using this dataset.

*1. Visualize the distribution of players by team*

*2. Show the distribution of player positions (POS)*

*3. Compare the average of PPG, RPG, APG across different teams*

*4. Visualize the relation of PPG and Minutes Per Game (MPG)*

### Step 5: Advanced Data Analysis
Finally, we will dive deeper into advanced analytical techniques, such as:
- Regression analysis to predict player performance
- Clustering to group similar players or teams
- Time series analysis to observe performance trends over the playoff period
