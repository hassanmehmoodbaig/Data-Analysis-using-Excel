# 2023-2024 NBA Player Stats | Playoffs

In this project, we will conduct a comprehensive data analysis of NBA player statistics during the 2023-2024 playoffs. The analysis will be executed in five structured steps, each focusing on a critical aspect of the data analysis process.

## Step 1: Data Gathering
For this analysis, we gathered our dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes player statistics, team performance metrics, and other relevant information from the playoffs. You can also download the dataset directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedsaqibshouqi/2023-2024-nba-player-stats-playoffs).
After downloading the file and importing it into Google Spreadsheet, it should be looking like this:

## Step 2: Data Cleaning
In this step, we will preprocess the data to ensure its quality. This involves:
- Removing duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Converting data types as needed
- Standardizing column names for consistency

In our case, the dataset is pretty cleaned so we can skip this step and go right into EDA.

## Step 3: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Exploratory Data Analysis will allow us to understand the data better. Here are some questions we will be answering using this dataset:

1. Which team has the most players in the dataset?
2. What are the average Points Per Game (PPG), Rebounds Per Game (RPG), and Assists Per Game (APG)?
3. Identify players with PPG above 20 and APG above 5.
4. Which team has the highest and lowest average usage percentage (USG%)?

## Step 4: Data Visualization Using Excel
In this step, we will create various visualizations in Google Sheets to present our findings. Here are some questions we will be answering using this dataset:

1. Visualize the distribution of players by team.
2. Show the distribution of player positions (POS).
3. Compare the average of PPG, RPG, APG across different teams.
4. Visualize the relationship between PPG and Minutes Per Game (MPG).

## Step 5: Advanced Data Analysis
Finally, we will dive deeper into advanced analytical techniques. Here are some questions we will be answering using this dataset:

1. Calculate the average Offensive Rating (ORtg) and Defensive Rating (DRtg) for each team.
2. Analyze the impact of a player's age on performance metrics (PPG, RPG, APG).
3. Identify players with the highest combined performance metrics (Points + Rebounds + Assists).
4. Determine the top player in each position (Guard, Forward, Center) based on PPG.

## Step 6: Review you Analysis
I did all these steps on a spreadsheet, you can view it here.
